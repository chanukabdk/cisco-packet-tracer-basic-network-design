## **Files Included**

- [Network Topology](network_topology.pkt): Cisco Packet Tracer file with the network design and configuration.
- [Router1 Configuration](configs/router1_config.md): Configuration commands used on the router.
- [Switch1 Configuration](configs/switch1_config.md): Configuration commands used on the switch1.
- [Switch2 Configuration](configs/switch2_config.md): Configuration commands used on the switch2.
- [Requirements](requirements.md): Detailed requirements and specifications for the project.
