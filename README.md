# Cisco Packet Tracer Project: Basic Network Design

## **Overview**

This repository contains the configuration files for a basic network design project created using Cisco Packet Tracer. The project demonstrates fundamental networking concepts and configurations, including router and switch setup, IP addressing, and basic network connectivity.

---

## **Project Details**

- **Network Topology**: Includes a simple LAN with one router, two switches, and four PCs.
- **Configurations**: Contains configuration files for routers and switches.
- **Purpose**: Designed to illustrate core networking principles such as IP addressing, VLANs, and routing basics.

---

## **Files Included**

- `Network_Topology.pkt`: Cisco Packet Tracer file with the network design and configuration.
- `Router_Configuration.md`: Configuration commands used on the router.
- `Switch1_Configuration.md`: Configuration commands used on the switch1.
- `Switch2_Configuration.md`: Configuration commands used on the switch2.
- `Project_Requirements.md`: Detailed requirements and specifications for the project.
